// Description of what I believe the function is doing:
// I understand that myFunction is a function that has two arguments being num1 and num2 (num1, num2). Inside the body of the function there is an instruction to ADD (demonstared with the + operator) the two arguments and RETURN the answer.
//const result is a variable that calls myFunction with num1 and num2, which in this case is 5 and 5. it will RETURN 10 and the result (the variable).


function myFunction(num1, num2) {
    return num1 + num2
}

const result = console.log(myFunction(5,5))

// After running the code, I was CORRECT
